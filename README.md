* Implementations of [role](https://github.com/protofire/tezos-contracts-examples/tree/master/security) based contract example.
* Flexible [owner](https://github.com/protofire/tezos-contracts-examples/tree/master/security) permissioning contract.
* Some [convertions](https://github.com/protofire/tezos-contracts-examples/tree/master/conversions) and [math](https://github.com/protofire/tezos-contracts-examples/tree/master/math) operations.
